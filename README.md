## Storing data with MongoDB


With this walkthrough you will learn and understand how you can connect to a mongoDB database via an express server and Node.js to understand how data is stored in the Backend.

The following files are already provided to ensure setup is clean and easy:
* `node_modules/`
* `package-lock.json`
* `package.json`

We will walkthrough the _server.js_ file to create, setup, and store data in your database.

### A little bit about databases!:

- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
- There are SQL databases and NoSQL databases
- SQL Databases are best for structured data with strict schemas, and NoSQL databases allow for flexible data structures
- MongoDB is a type of NoSQL database! We will be exploring that in this Demo.


### Reminders! about MongoDB

- Keep your user password safe, preferably in an .env file
- Configure network access
